Which method do you prefer?

Since the XML syntax uses the tag structure, which similar to HTML, it is easier to adopt and understand for users who only have HTML experience, like us. Unfortunately, XML takes longer because there is so much more to type because of the tag structure.  
Most of our team members are experienced with HTML, but most of our team has never worked with JSON. JSON uses a syntax that we are not used to and there for requires a learning curve, but once that learning curve is understood, JSON is easier to write and read.

So, we all agree that JSON is our preferred method once our team all comes to a clear understanding of what it looks like and how it works.
