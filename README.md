Which method do you prefer?

Because  XML syntax take use of the tag which similar to HTML, it is easier to adopt and follow. But there is more typing to do to label each attribute and variable.  
Some of our team member are experienced with HTML but does not know JavaScript at all. Json uses a different syntax that work with JavaScript that requires a learning curve.

We all agree that json is more preferred once we understand more on how it is applied in the JavaScript function.
